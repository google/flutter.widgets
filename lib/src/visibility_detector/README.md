VisibilityDetector
==================

A `VisibilityDetector` widget wraps an existing Flutter widget and fires a
callback when the widget's visibility changes. (It actually reports when the
visibility of the `VisibilityDetector` itself changes, and its visibility is
expected to be identical to that of its child.)

For more details, see the documentation to the `VisibilityDetector` and
`VisibilityInfo` classes.
