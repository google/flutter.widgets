# Flutter widgets

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/google/flutter.widgets.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google/flutter.widgets)

This repository contains the source code for various Flutter widgets that are
developed by Google but not by the core Flutter team.

The Gallery sample application showcases the included Flutter widgets.  To
build it, first create the default Flutter project files:

```
cd gallery
flutter create .
```
and then it can be run with `flutter run`.
