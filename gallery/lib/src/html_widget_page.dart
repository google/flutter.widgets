<b><u>I. The Period</u></b>
<br/>
<b>It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times,
it was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foolishness,
it was the epoch of belief,
it was the epoch of incredulity,
it was the season of Light,
it was the season of Darkness,
it was the spring of hope,
it was the winter of despair,</b>
<br/>
we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going
direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way— in short, the
period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest
authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in
the superlative degree of comparison only.
<br/>
There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the
throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair
face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal
to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things
in general were settled for ever.
<br/>
It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.
Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period,
as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth
blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had
heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made
for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost
had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its messages,
as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient
in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the earthly order of
events had lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress
of British subjects in America: which, strange to relate, have
proved more important to the human race than any communications yet
received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood.
<br/>
France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of
the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making
paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her Christian pastors,
she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements as sentencing a
youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and his
body burned alive, because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour
to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view, at a distance of
some fifty or sixty yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of
France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to
death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into
boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it,
terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of
some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered from
the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed
about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer, Death, had already
set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution. But that Woodman and that
Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them
as they went about with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain
any suspicion that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.
<br/>
In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify
much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and highway
robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families were
publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture
to upholsterers’ warehouses for security; the highwayman in the dark was a
City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and challenged by his
fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of “the Captain,” gallantly
shot him through the head and rode away; the mail was waylaid by seven robbers,
and the guard shot three dead, and then got shot dead himself by the other
four, “in consequence of the failure of his ammunition:” after which the mail
was robbed in peace; that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London,
was made to stand and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who
despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners
in London gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of
the law fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot
and ball; thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords
at Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles’s, to search for
contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers
fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of
the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy and ever worse
than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing up long rows of
miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had
been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the hand at Newgate by the
dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall; to-day,
taking the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched
pilferer who had robbed a farmer’s boy of sixpence.
<br/>
All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close upon
the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Environed by
them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded, those two of the
large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the fair faces, trod with
stir enough, and carried their divine rights with a high hand. Thus did the
year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses,
and myriads of small creatures—the creatures of this chronicle among the
rest—along the roads that lay before them.
<br/>
<b><u>II. The Mail</u></b>
<br/>
It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November, before
the first of the persons with whom this history has business. The Dover
road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up Shooter’s
Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail, as the rest
of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish for walking
exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the harness,
and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the horses had three times
already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach across the road, with
the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath. Reins and whip and
coachman and guard, however, in combination, had read that article of war
which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that
some brute animals are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated
and returned to their duty.
<br/>
With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through the
thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were falling
to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested them and brought
them to a stand, with a wary “Wo-ho! so-ho-then!” the near leader violently
shook his head and everything upon it—like an unusually emphatic horse, denying
that the coach could be got up the hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle,
the passenger started, as a nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.
<br/>
There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its
forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding
none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the air
in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the waves of
an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out everything from
the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings, and a few yards of
road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it, as if they had
made it all.
<br/>
Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the side
of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the ears, and
wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from anything he saw,
what either of the other two was like; and each was hidden under almost as
many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from the eyes of the body, of
his two companions. In those days, travellers were very shy of being
confidential on a short notice, for anybody on the road might be a robber
or in league with robbers. As to the latter, when every posting-house and
ale-house could produce somebody in “the Captain’s” pay, ranging from the
landlord to the lowest stable non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon
the cards. So the guard of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday
night in November, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering
up Shooter’s Hill, as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail,
beating his feet, and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him,
where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded
horse-pistols, deposited on a substratum of cutlass.
<br/>
The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected
the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they all
suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses;
as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have taken his oath on
the two Testaments that they were not fit for the journey.
<br/>
“Wo-ho!” said the coachman. “So, then! One more pull and you’re at the
top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to it!—Joe!”
<br/>
“Halloa!” the guard replied.
<br/>
“What o’clock do you make it, Joe?”
<br/>
“Ten minutes, good, past eleven.”
<br/>
“My blood!” ejaculated the vexed coachman, “and not atop of Shooter’s yet!
Tst! Yah! Get on with you!”
<br/>
The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative,
made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed suit.
Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its passengers
squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach stopped, and
they kept close company with it. If any one of the three had had the
hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into the mist
and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of getting shot
instantly as a highwayman.
