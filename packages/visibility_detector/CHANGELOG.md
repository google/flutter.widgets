# CHANGELOG

## 0.4.0

* Refactor to avoid forcing composition in the layer/render trees.
* Remove `VisibilityDetectorLayer`.

  functionality from the old layer.

  the rect to `VisibilityInfo`.

  constraints correctly to 2.12.0 instead.

  been set to 2.12.0 instead of 2.10.5.

  which introduced unexpected memory usage.
